  // OR WE CAN ALSO WRITE IT AS   ***************
//   The idea is that we pass a function and expect it to be “called back” later if necessary. In our case, showOk becomes the callback for “yes” answer, and showCancel for “no” answer.

//   Functions are values. They can be assigned, copied or declared in any place of the code.
// If the function is declared as a separate statement in the main code flow, that’s called a “Function Declaration”.
// If the function is created as a part of an expression, it’s called a “Function Expression”.
// Function Declarations are processed before the code block is executed. They are visible everywhere in the block.
// Function Expressions are created when the execution flow reaches them.
